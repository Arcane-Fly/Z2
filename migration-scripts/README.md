## Usage

Each script is designed to be run independently and includes rollback strategies.

```bash
# Run Phase 1 - Foundation migrations
./phase-1-feature-architecture.sh

# Run Phase 2 - Component optimization
./phase-2-component-colocation.sh

# Run Phase 3 - Performance optimization  
./phase-3-bundle-optimization.sh
```

```bash
./validate-migration.sh
```
