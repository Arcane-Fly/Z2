# Z2 Railway Deployment - Final Configuration Summary

## ‚úÖ Current Status: COMPLIANT with Railway Master Cheat Sheet

### Deployment Architecture
- **Build System:** Railpack-only (NO competing configurations)
- **Backend (Z2B):** Python 3.11 + Poetry + FastAPI + uvicorn
- **Frontend (Z2F):** Node.js 22 + Yarn 4.9.2 + Vite + Express static server

### Configuration Files (Railpack-Only)
```
/railpack.json              # Root monorepo configuration
/backend/railpack.json      # Backend Python/Poetry config
/frontend/railpack.json     # Frontend Node.js/Yarn config
```

### ‚ùå Files That DO NOT Exist (Correctly)
Following Railway Master Cheat Sheet, these competing configurations are NOT present:
- No `Dockerfile` or `Dockerfile.*` files
- No `railway.toml` files  
- No `railway.json` files
- No `nixpacks.toml` files
- No `Procfile` files

This ensures Railway uses railpack.json as the single source of build truth.

### üîß Service Configuration

#### Backend (Z2B)
- **Root Directory:** `/backend`
- **Start Command:** `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- **Health Check:** `/health`
- **Environment Variables:** Uses Railway references for DATABASE_URL, JWT secrets

#### Frontend (Z2F)  
- **Root Directory:** `./frontend`
- **Build Command:** `yarn build` (creates `dist/` directory)
- **Start Command:** `yarn start` ‚Üí `node server.js` (serves static files from `dist/`)
- **Health Check:** `/api/health`

### üîç Validation

Run the compliant validation script:
```bash
bash scripts/railway-railpack-validation.sh
```

This validates:
- ‚úÖ No competing build configurations
- ‚úÖ Railpack.json files exist and are valid JSON
- ‚úÖ Proper PORT environment variable usage
- ‚úÖ Host binding to 0.0.0.0 (not localhost)
- ‚úÖ Health endpoints configured
- ‚úÖ Critical build outputs (dist/) not ignored

### üö® Critical Fix Applied

**Problem:** Frontend `.railwayignore` was excluding `dist/` directory
**Impact:** Railway couldn't serve built frontend files
**Solution:** Removed `dist/` and `build/` from frontend `.railwayignore`

### üìã Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to Railway:

- [ ] Run `bash scripts/railway-railpack-validation.sh` (must pass)
- [ ] Verify frontend builds: `cd frontend && yarn build` 
- [ ] Check `frontend/dist/` directory exists with built files
- [ ] Confirm no competing build configs exist
- [ ] Test health endpoints work locally

### üõ†Ô∏è Railway Commands

```bash
# Force railpack rebuild
railway up --force

# Check environment variables
railway run env | grep -E '(PORT|HOST|RAILWAY)'

# Test health endpoints
railway run curl http://localhost:$PORT/health      # Backend
railway run curl http://localhost:$PORT/api/health  # Frontend
```

### üèÜ Compliance Status

‚úÖ **FULLY COMPLIANT** with Railway Deployment Master Cheat Sheet:
- Railpack-only build system (single source of truth)
- Proper PORT/HOST binding patterns
- Health checks implemented and configured
- No competing build configurations
- Critical build outputs properly included

This configuration eliminates common Railway deployment issues:
- "No start command could be found" errors
- "Build system conflicts" 
- "Application failed to respond" due to port/host issues
- Missing build artifacts due to incorrect ignore patterns
