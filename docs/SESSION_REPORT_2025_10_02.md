# Development Session Report - October 2, 2025

## Session Overview

**Objective**: Comprehensive platform compliance review, GitHub Actions validation, and Railway deployment verification.

**Duration**: Single session  
**Focus Areas**: CI/CD, Railway deployment, past PR review, build fixes

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **All objectives achieved**:
- No failing GitHub Actions workflows
- Railway configurations fully compliant with best practices
- All past PR comments reviewed (none outstanding)
- Documentation aligned with Railway official best practices
- Build issues identified and resolved
- Repository hygiene improvements implemented

---

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Frontend Build Configuration ❌→✅

**Issue**: Missing terser dependency caused Vite production build failures
```
error: terser not found. Since Vite v3, terser has become an optional dependency.
```

**Root Cause**: Vite config specified `minify: 'terser'` but terser was not in devDependencies

**Solution**:
- Added `terser` to `frontend/package.json` devDependencies
- Verified build completes successfully in 6.5s

**Impact**: Frontend can now build for production reliably

---

### 2. Tailwind CSS v4 Compatibility ❌→✅

**Issue**: Build warning for unknown utility class `border-border`
```
Error: Cannot apply unknown utility class `border-border`
```

**Root Cause**: `@apply border-border` syntax incompatible with Tailwind CSS v4 stricter validation

**Solution**:
Changed from:
```css
* {
  @apply border-border;
}
```

To:
```css
* {
  border-color: hsl(var(--border));
}
```

**Impact**: Eliminates build warnings, ensures Tailwind v4 compatibility

---

### 3. Build Artifacts in Version Control ❌→✅

**Issue**: `frontend/dist/` folder (build artifacts) committed to repository

**Root Cause**: Missing entries in `.gitignore`

**Solution**:
- Added `dist/` to `frontend/.gitignore`
- Added `node_modules/` to prevent future commits
- Removed existing artifacts from git history

**Impact**: 
- Cleaner repository
- Faster CI/CD pipeline
- No merge conflicts on build artifacts

---

## Platform Compliance Verification

### Railway Deployment Configuration

#### Frontend (frontend/railpack.json) ✅ COMPLIANT

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "metadata": { "name": "z2f-frontend" },
  "build": {
    "provider": "node",
    "steps": {
      "install": {
        "commands": [
          "corepack enable",
          "corepack prepare yarn@4.9.2 --activate",
          "yarn install --immutable --network-timeout 600000"
        ]
      },
      "build": {
        "commands": ["yarn build"]
      }
    }
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "yarn start",
    "healthCheckPath": "/health",
    "healthCheckTimeout": 300
  }
}
```

**Compliance Checklist**:
- ✅ Uses Yarn 4.9.2 (matches RAILWAY_CODING_RULES.md)
- ✅ No competing build files (Dockerfile, nixpacks.toml, Procfile)
- ✅ Health check configured
- ✅ Proper start command

**Server Configuration** (`frontend/server.js`):
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4173;
const HOST = '0.0.0.0'; // Railway requires binding to 0.0.0.0

app.get('/health', (req, res) => { /* ... */ });
app.get('/api/health', (req, res) => { /* ... */ });

app.listen(PORT, HOST, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://${HOST}:${PORT}`);
});
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ PORT binding uses environment variable
- ✅ Host binding to 0.0.0.0 (not localhost)
- ✅ Health endpoints implemented

---

#### Backend (backend/railpack.json) ✅ COMPLIANT

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "metadata": { "name": "z2b-backend" },
  "build": {
    "provider": "python",
    "steps": {
      "install": {
        "commands": [
          "pip install --upgrade pip",
          "pip install -r requirements.txt"
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT",
    "healthCheckPath": "/health",
    "healthCheckTimeout": 300,
    "variables": {
      "JWT_SECRET_KEY": "${{JWT_SECRET_KEY}}",
      "DATABASE_URL": "${{DATABASE_URL}}"
    }
  }
}
```

**Compliance Checklist**:
- ✅ Python provider with proper dependency management
- ✅ Start command binds to 0.0.0.0:$PORT
- ✅ Health checks implemented at multiple endpoints
- ✅ Environment variables use Railway injection syntax
- ✅ No competing build files

**Health Endpoints** (`backend/app/main.py`):
```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy"}

@app.get("/health/live")
async def liveness_check():
    return {"status": "alive"}

@app.get("/health/ready")
async def readiness_check():
    return {"status": "ready"}
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ Multiple health check endpoints
- ✅ Proper status responses
- ✅ Ready for Railway health monitoring
