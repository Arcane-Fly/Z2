# Z2 Best Practices

This document outlines the core principles and practices for developing Z2, focusing on quality, performance, and security.

## Development Philosophy

*   **User Intent Understanding:** Prioritize designing prompts, agent workflows, and UI interactions that accurately capture and translate user goals into executable plans. Invest in robust intent parsing.
*   **Adaptability at All Costs:** Build systems that can dynamically adjust workflows, select appropriate models/tools, and handle unexpected inputs gracefully to achieve the user's ultimate objective.
*   **Observability First:** Instrument agents and core components from the beginning. Log decisions, tool calls, state changes, and performance metrics to enable debugging and optimization.
*   **Modularity & Reusability:** Design agents, prompts, and components to be modular and reusable across different workflows or contexts.

## Testing

*   **Philosophy:** A balanced approach combining unit testing for core logic, integration testing for API endpoints and agent interactions, and end-to-end testing for critical user journeys.
*   **Unit Testing:** Pytest (Python), Jest/Vitest (JS). Aim for high coverage on business logic and core agent functions.
*   **Integration Testing:** Test interactions between services (e.g., backend API calling LLMs, database interactions, agent tool usage).
*   **Agent Testing:** Specific tests for agent workflows, including simulating various inputs and verifying goal completion or appropriate fallbacks.
*   **Prompt Testing:** Dedicated evaluation of prompts for accuracy, robustness, and potential failure modes. Consider using frameworks like Agenta for systematic prompt testing.

## Performance vs. Readability

*   **Readability is King:** Prioritize code clarity and maintainability. Complex optimizations should only be introduced if performance profiling identifies a clear bottleneck.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Leverage FastAPI's async capabilities and concurrent processing for I/O-bound tasks (like LLM calls) to improve responsiveness.
*   **Efficient Prompting:** Use shorter, structured prompts where possible (like Cluely) for cost/latency efficiency without sacrificing quality. Employ techniques like Few-Shot learning contextually.
*   **Caching:** Implement intelligent caching (e.g., Redis) for expensive computations or frequent LLM responses that are unlikely to change rapidly.
*   **Model Selection:** Dynamically choose models based on task complexity/cost requirements (e.g., GPT-4o-mini for simple tasks, Claude 4 Sonnet for complex analysis, o3-mini for STEM reasoning).

## Security

*   **Input Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs rigorously to prevent injection attacks (prompt injection, SQL injection, XSS).
*   **API Security:** Implement authentication (JWT/OAuth), enforce rate limiting, and use secure headers.
*   **LLM Security:**
    *   Employ guardrails and filters to prevent jailbreaking, toxic content generation, and PII leakage.
    *   Be cautious with user data sent to LLMs; consider scrubbing or anonymization where necessary.
    *   Monitor for adversarial prompts.
*   **Data Protection:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Minimize the collection and retention of PII.
*   **Secrets Management:** Never hardcode API keys or secrets. Use environment variables managed securely by the platform (Railway).
*   **Compliance Awareness:** Be mindful of standards like GDPR, ISO/IEC 42001, and NIST AI RMF during design and implementation.

## Deployment & Operations

*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Define deployment configurations declaratively (Dockerfile, Railway config).
*   **Continuous Integration/Deployment:** Automate testing and deployment pipelines.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Set up monitoring for application health, LLM API usage/costs, error rates, and performance metrics. Configure alerts for anomalies.
*   **Scalability Planning:** Design stateless components where possible. Plan for horizontal scaling of the application and agent workers.

With these standards defined, we can now proceed with planning the product.

@plan-product
I want to build Z2: An intuitive, highly adaptable, and orchestrated AI workforce platform. It allows users (developers and non-developers) to define goals, and the system dynamically plans, selects appropriate models/tools (swarming, teams, orchestrated workflows), and executes tasks autonomously to completion.
Key features:
1.  Dynamic Prompt Generation & Adaptation: System automatically crafts and refines prompts based on context and goal progress.
2.  Multi-Agent Orchestration: Create, manage, and deploy swarms/teams of specialized AI agents (researcher, writer, coder, planner, executor) that collaborate.
3.  Goal-Oriented Execution: Users define a high-level goal, the system breaks it down, plans actions, executes via agents, and adapts the plan as needed until the goal is met or clarified.
4.  Intuitive UX: Point-and-shoot interface for non-developers; powerful configuration for developers. System deeply understands user intent.
5.  Broad Model Integration: Seamlessly integrates with top LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, Perplexity) via standardized APIs.
6.  Observability & Control: Real-time dashboards showing agent activity, decisions, resource usage. Allow user intervention/steering.
Target users: Developers needing rapid AI prototyping/deployment and anyone wanting an autonomous AI workforce.
Tech stack: Use the standards defined in `~/.agent-os/standards/tech-stack.md`. Primary hosting on Railway.com. Leverage the API documentation from https://ai1docs.abacusai.app/ for integrations.
