# Z2 Roadmap

## Overview

**Vision**: Provide a multi-agent AI platform that orchestrates diverse LLMs to deliver complex tasks with security, compliance and rich user experiences.

**Current Status**: Z2 has evolved significantly with substantial implementation across multiple phases. The backend features comprehensive API endpoints, database models, authentication system, and advanced protocol implementations. The frontend provides a functional React application with TypeScript.
