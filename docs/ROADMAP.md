# Z2 Roadmap

## Overview

**Vision**: Provide a multi-agent AI platform that orchestrates diverse LLMs to deliver complex tasks with security, compliance and rich user experiences.

**Current Status**: Z2 has evolved significantly with substantial implementation across multiple phases. The backend features comprehensive API endpoints, database models, authentication system, and advanced protocol implementations. The frontend provides a functional React application with TypeScript. Phase 5 (A2A & MCP Protocol) has been completed, Phase 3 (Core Model Integration) is 80% complete with 6 major providers implemented, and Phase 7 (Frontend) has made significant progress with working modals and real-time features. The platform is now positioned for expansion to the full 58-model, 8-provider ecosystem outlined in the AI_MODELS_MANIFEST.md.

This roadmap reflects the current implementation status and outlines the path to both production readiness and the comprehensive AI platform vision.
