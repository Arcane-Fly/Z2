## üìù Notes & Learnings

### What Went Well
1. **Smooth Installation**: Nx init process was straightforward despite Yarn 4 nuances
2. **Immediate Value**: Cache working on first try - instant developer gratification
3. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing `yarn workspaces` commands still work
4. **Documentation Quality**: Comprehensive analysis helped make informed decisions
5. **Low Risk**: Minimal changes, easy to roll back if needed

### Challenges Faced
1. **Yarn 4 Syntax**: Required enabling corepack, slightly different from Yarn 1
2. **Interactive Prompts**: Needed manual selection during `nx init`
3. **Dependencies**: Forgot to install frontend dependencies initially

### Best Practices Applied
1. ‚úÖ **Minimal Changes**: Only added Nx, didn't remove existing tools
2. ‚úÖ **Incremental Adoption**: Started with basic config, can expand later
3. ‚úÖ **Documentation First**: Created comprehensive guides before implementing
4. ‚úÖ **Validation**: Tested caching immediately after setup
5. ‚úÖ **Version Control**: Proper git commit messages and progress tracking

### Recommendations for Next Sessions
1. **Measure Everything**: Collect baseline metrics before optimizing
2. **Team Feedback**: Get developer input on Nx experience
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Don't force all developers to use Nx immediately
4. **Monitor Cache Size**: Check `.nx/cache` directory growth
5. **Document Failures**: Track cache misses and understand why
