**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: ✅ Fully Compliant  
**Master Cheat Sheet Version**: 1.0

## Executive Summary

Z2 has been updated to strictly comply with the Railway + Yarn 4.9.2+ + MCP/A2A Master Cheat Sheet. All changes ensure production-ready deployments with proper build configurations, health checks, and package management.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Railpack Configuration Updates

#### Root `railpack.json`
**Before**: Basic structure without required metadata
**After**: Full compliance with master cheat sheet

Changes:
- ✅ Added `version: "1"` field
- ✅ Added `metadata.name: "z2-workspace"`
- ✅ Added `build.provider: "node"`
- ✅ Changed `--immutable` to `--frozen-lockfile` for Yarn
- ✅ Added explicit Corepack activation step
- ✅ Added health check configuration (`/api/health`)
- ✅ Added restart policy (`ON_FAILURE`, 3 retries)

#### Backend `backend/railpack.json`
**Before**: Missing metadata and proper structure
**After**: Fully structured Python service configuration

Changes:
- ✅ Added `version: "1"` field
- ✅ Added `metadata.name: "z2-backend"`
- ✅ Wrapped steps in `build` object with proper structure
- ✅ Added restart policy configuration

#### Frontend `frontend/railpack.json`
**Before**: Missing metadata, used deprecated flags
**After**: Modern Node.js service configuration

Changes:
- ✅ Added `version: "1"` field
- ✅ Added `metadata.name: "z2-frontend"`
- ✅ Changed `--immutable` to `--frozen-lockfile`
- ✅ Added explicit Corepack activation step
- ✅ Added restart policy configuration

### 2. Yarn Configuration Enhancements

#### `.yarnrc.yml`
**Added**: Performance optimization for Railway

Changes:
- ✅ Added `nmMode: hardlinks-local` for faster installs
- ✅ Maintained global cache and node-modules linker

#### `constraints.pro` (New File)
**Purpose**: Enforce workspace consistency

Features:
- ✅ Enforces Node.js 20+ across all workspaces
- ✅ Enforces Yarn 4.9.2+ across all workspaces
- ✅ Ensures `workspace:*` protocol for internal dependencies
- ✅ Maintains consistent dependency versions
- ✅ Enforces MIT license for public packages

### 3. Package Configuration

#### Root `package.json`
Changes:
- ✅ Updated Node.js engine requirement from `>=18.0.0` to `>=20.0.0`

#### Frontend `frontend/package.json`
Changes:
- ✅ Added `engines` section with Node.js 20+ and Yarn 4.9.2+ requirements
- ✅ Added MIT license field

### 4. Vite Configuration

#### `frontend/vite.config.ts`
Changes:
- ✅ Set `cssCodeSplit: false` for Railway predictable CSS bundling
- ✅ Added comment explaining Railway optimization

### 5. Documentation

#### New Document: `docs/RAILWAY_YARN_MCP_MASTER_GUIDE.md`
Comprehensive implementation guide covering:
- Railpack configuration standards
- Yarn workspace management
- MCP/A2A integration patterns
- Service communication
- Deployment checklists
- Troubleshooting guides
- Local development setup

#### Updated: `README.md`
Changes:
- ✅ Updated Railway deployment section
- ✅ Added reference to master implementation guide
- ✅ Corrected outdated railway.toml references
- ✅ Added Yarn 4.9.2 setup instructions

## Validation Results

### JSON Syntax
```
✅ railpack.json - Valid
✅ backend/railpack.json - Valid
✅ frontend/railpack.json - Valid
```

### Yarn Constraints
```
✅ All workspace constraints pass
✅ Node.js 20+ enforced
✅ Yarn 4.9.2+ enforced
```

### Railway Railpack Validation
```
✅ No competing build configurations
✅ Proper PORT environment variable usage
✅ Correct host binding (0.0.0.0)
✅ Health check endpoints configured
✅ Critical build outputs not ignored
```

## Compliance Checklist

### Build Configuration
- [x] Only railpack.json files exist (no Dockerfile, railway.toml, etc.)
- [x] All railpack.json files have `version: "1"`
- [x] All railpack.json files have `metadata.name`
- [x] All railpack.json files have `build.provider`
- [x] All railpack.json files are valid JSON

### Package Management
- [x] Yarn 4.9.2+ configured via Corepack
- [x] Use `--frozen-lockfile` instead of `--immutable`
- [x] Constraints file enforces consistency
- [x] Node.js 20+ required in all workspaces
- [x] Yarn 4.9.2+ required in all workspaces

### Port & Host Binding
- [x] All services use `process.env.PORT` or `$PORT`
- [x] All services bind to `0.0.0.0` (not localhost)
- [x] No hardcoded ports in production code

### Health Checks
- [x] Backend implements `/health` endpoint
- [x] Frontend implements `/health` and `/api/health` endpoints
- [x] All railpack.json files configure health checks
- [x] Health check timeout set to 300 seconds

### Restart Policies
- [x] All services have `restartPolicyType: "ON_FAILURE"`
- [x] All services have `restartPolicyMaxRetries: 3`

### Vite Configuration
- [x] `cssCodeSplit: false` for Railway
- [x] `base: './'` for relative paths
- [x] Proper host binding in server/preview
