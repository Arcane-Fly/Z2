# DELETED - Railway Frontend Dockerfile Removed

This file has been removed to prevent conflicts with Nixpacks build system.
Railway should use the service configuration and Nixpacks instead of Docker.

The original file has been backed up as:
- Dockerfile.frontend.backup (root level)  
- frontend/Dockerfile.backup

To restore Docker builds, rename one of these backup files back to Dockerfile.
