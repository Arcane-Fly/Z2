# Railway Service Status - Z2B & Z2F

**Last Updated**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: üî¥ BLOCKED - Infrastructure Issue

## Quick Summary

Both Z2B (Backend) and Z2F (Frontend) services are currently unable to deploy due to Railway infrastructure disk space limitations during the Nixpacks build process. Configuration fixes have been applied, but deployments remain blocked until Railway support resolves the disk space constraint.

## Service Status

### Z2B Backend
- **Status**: ‚ùå FAILED
- **Service ID**: `169631f2-0f90-466d-89b8-a67f240a18b5`
- **Error**: `ResourceExhausted: no space left on device`
- **Builder**: Nixpacks v1.40.0
- **Fixed Issues**: Start command corrected to use uvicorn

### Z2F Frontend
- **Status**: ‚ùå FAILED  
- **Service ID**: `94ef6eda-e787-47df-bf33-0a8a4bc25533`
- **Error**: `ResourceExhausted: no space left on device`
- **Builder**: Nixpacks v1.40.0
- **Fixed Issues**: Yarn hash mismatch resolved

## Issues Identified & Resolution Status

| Issue | Service | Status | Priority |
|-------|---------|--------|----------|
| Incorrect start command (yarn ‚Üí uvicorn) | Z2B | ‚úÖ Fixed | High |
| Yarn packageManager hash mismatch | Z2F | ‚úÖ Fixed | High |
| Railway build disk space exhaustion | Both | ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked | Critical |

## What Was Done

### Configuration Fixes Applied ‚úÖ
1. **Z2B Start Command**: Updated Railway service settings from `yarn start` to `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
2. **Yarn Hash Removal**: Removed SHA-512 hashes from `/package.json` and `/frontend/package.json` to resolve corepack validation errors

### Inspection Completed ‚úÖ
- Comprehensive service inspection using Railway MCP
- Deployment history analysis
- Build logs review
- Environment variables verification
- Health check endpoint validation
- Service configuration audit

### Documentation Created ‚úÖ
- Detailed inspection report: `docs/railway-service-inspection-2025-10-11.md`
- Root cause analysis for all identified issues
- Recommendations for short-term and long-term fixes

## Current Blocker

**Railway Build Environment Disk Space**

Both services fail during Nixpacks build with:
```
error: writing to file: No space left on device
Build Failed: ResourceExhausted: no space left on device
```

This occurs during:
- **Z2B**: Python dependency installation via Poetry
- **Z2F**: Nix package unpacking phase

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Contact Railway Support**: Request increased disk allocation for build environment
   - Reference: Service IDs above
   - Error: ResourceExhausted during Nixpacks build
   - Affects: Both production services

### Short-term (1-3 days)
1. **Implement Multi-Stage Docker Build**: Reduce build footprint
2. **Optimize Dependencies**: Review and reduce package sizes where possible
3. **Custom Dockerfile**: Consider switching from Nixpacks to custom Dockerfile for better control

### Long-term (1+ weeks)
1. **Build Caching Strategy**: Implement aggressive caching for dependencies
2. **Dependency Audit**: Review ML/AI library requirements and optimize
3. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Set up alerts for build resource utilization

## How to Monitor

### Check Service Status
```bash
# Using Railway CLI
railway status

# Or check Railway Dashboard
https://railway.app/project/359de66a-b9de-486c-8fb4-c56fda52344f
```

### Check Deployment Logs
```bash
# Z2B Backend
railway logs -s Z2B

# Z2F Frontend  
railway logs -s Z2F
```

### Health Check Endpoints (When Deployed)
- **Z2B**: `https://z2b-production.up.railway.app/health`
- **Z2F**: `https://z2-production.up.railway.app/health`

## Service Configuration

### Z2B Backend
```json
{
  "root_directory": "backend",
  "start_command": "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT",
  "health_check": "/health",
  "builder": "Nixpacks",
  "region": "Not set",
  "replicas": 1
}
```

### Z2F Frontend
```json
{
  "root_directory": "frontend",
  "start_command": "yarn start",
  "health_check": "/health",
  "builder": "Nixpacks",
  "region": "Not set",
  "replicas": 1
}
```
