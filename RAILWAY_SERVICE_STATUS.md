# Railway Service Status - Z2B & Z2F

**Last Updated**: October 26, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… FIXED - Configuration Conflict Resolved

## Quick Summary

The Z2B (Backend) service was experiencing `yarn: command not found` errors due to a configuration conflict. The issue has been resolved by removing the competing `backend/railway.toml` file, ensuring Railway uses only the railpack.json configuration as per the Railway Master Cheat Sheet standards.

## Service Status

### Z2B Backend
- **Status**: âœ… FIXED
- **Service ID**: `169631f2-0f90-466d-89b8-a67f240a18b5`
- **Previous Error**: `/bin/bash: line 1: yarn: command not found`
- **Root Cause**: Competing configuration files (railway.toml + railpack.json)
- **Resolution**: Removed backend/railway.toml to use railpack-only configuration
- **Builder**: Railpack (Python provider)

### Z2F Frontend
- **Status**: âœ… READY  
- **Service ID**: `94ef6eda-e787-47df-bf33-0a8a4bc25533`
- **Builder**: Railpack (Node.js provider)
- **Fixed Issues**: Yarn hash mismatch resolved

## Issues Identified & Resolution Status

| Issue | Service | Status | Priority |
|-------|---------|--------|----------|
| Competing configuration files (railway.toml + railpack.json) | Z2B | âœ… Fixed | Critical |
| Yarn command not found error | Z2B | âœ… Fixed | High |
| Yarn packageManager hash mismatch | Z2F | âœ… Fixed | High |

## What Was Done

### Configuration Fixes Applied âœ…
1. **Railway.toml Removal (Oct 26, 2025)**: Removed `backend/railway.toml` to eliminate configuration conflicts
   - Railway now uses only railpack.json (single source of truth)
   - Follows Railway Master Cheat Sheet standards
   - Fixes "yarn: command not found" error
2. **Z2B Start Command (Oct 11, 2025)**: Updated Railway service settings from `yarn start` to `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
3. **Yarn Hash Removal (Oct 11, 2025)**: Removed SHA-512 hashes from `/package.json` and `/frontend/package.json` to resolve corepack validation errors

### Inspection Completed âœ…
- Comprehensive service inspection using Railway MCP
- Deployment history analysis
- Build logs review
- Environment variables verification
- Health check endpoint validation
- Service configuration audit

### Documentation Created âœ…
- Detailed inspection report: `docs/railway-service-inspection-2025-10-11.md`
- Root cause analysis for all identified issues
- Recommendations for short-term and long-term fixes

## Current Status

**All Configuration Issues Resolved âœ…**

The backend service is now properly configured with:
- Railpack-only build system (no competing configurations)
- Correct Python/Poetry provider setup
- Proper uvicorn start command
- Health check endpoint configured at `/health`

Validation script confirms all Railway deployment standards are met.

## Next Steps

### Deployment
1. âœ… **Configuration Fixed**: Backend railway.toml removed
2. âœ… **Validation Passed**: All Railway deployment standards met
3. ðŸš€ **Ready to Deploy**: Services can now be deployed to Railway
   - Backend will use: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
   - Frontend will use: `yarn start` (node server.js)

### Monitoring
1. **Monitor Initial Deployment**: Verify successful startup
2. **Check Health Endpoints**: Ensure health checks respond correctly
3. **Review Logs**: Confirm no configuration errors

## How to Monitor

### Check Service Status
```bash
# Using Railway CLI
railway status

# Or check Railway Dashboard
https://railway.app/project/359de66a-b9de-486c-8fb4-c56fda52344f
```

### Check Deployment Logs
```bash
# Z2B Backend
railway logs -s Z2B

# Z2F Frontend  
railway logs -s Z2F
```

### Health Check Endpoints (When Deployed)
- **Z2B**: `https://z2b-production.up.railway.app/health`
- **Z2F**: `https://z2-production.up.railway.app/health`

## Service Configuration

### Z2B Backend
```json
{
  "root_directory": "backend",
  "start_command": "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT",
  "health_check": "/health",
  "builder": "Nixpacks",
  "region": "Not set",
  "replicas": 1
}
```

### Z2F Frontend
```json
{
  "root_directory": "frontend",
  "start_command": "yarn start",
  "health_check": "/health",
  "builder": "Nixpacks",
  "region": "Not set",
  "replicas": 1
}
```
