# React/TypeScript Project Architecture Analyzer

A comprehensive tool for analyzing React/TypeScript projects and generating executable modernization plans aligned with 2025 best practices.

## Overview

This analyzer examines your React/TypeScript codebase to identify architectural optimization opportunities and provides concrete migration strategies with executable commands, configuration diffs, and rollback plans.

## Features

### 🔍 **Comprehensive Analysis**
- **Folder Structure Assessment**: Detects technical vs feature-based organization patterns
- **Component Organization**: Analyzes co-location patterns and maintainability
- **TypeScript Usage Depth**: Evaluates strict mode, advanced patterns, and domain modeling
- **Coupling Analysis**: Identifies cross-domain dependencies and architectural debt
- **Modernization Readiness**: Scores for monorepo, micro-frontends, tree-shaking, and performance

### 📊 **Architecture Assessment Against 2025 Standards**

#### Current Pattern Recognition
- Technical grouping (components/, hooks/, services/) vs Feature-based architecture
- Component co-location patterns (tests, stories, barrel exports)
- TypeScript configuration depth and domain modeling maturity
- Tree-shaking optimization and bundle splitting strategies

#### Modernization Scoring
- **Monorepo Score**: Yarn workspaces, Turborepo/Nx readiness
- **Micro-frontend Readiness**: Module federation, feature boundaries
- **Tree-shaking Optimization**: Barrel exports, sideEffects configuration
- **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting, lazy loading implementation

### 🛠️ **Executable Migration Plans**

The analyzer generates three-phase migration strategies:

#### **Phase 1: Foundation (P0 Issues)**
- Migrate from technical to feature-based folder structure
- Enable TypeScript strict mode with gradual migration
- Establish proper domain boundaries

#### **Phase 2: Enhancement (P1 Issues)** 
- Implement component co-location patterns
- Optimize tree-shaking and barrel exports
- Improve maintainability and developer experience

#### **Phase 3: Optimization (P2 Issues)**
- Advanced bundle optimization and code splitting
- Lazy loading and performance improvements
- Monorepo migration preparation (if applicable)

## Usage

### Basic Analysis

```bash
# Analyze current directory
node react-analyzer.js

# Analyze specific project
node react-analyzer.js /path/to/project

# Analyze with TypeScript
npx ts-node react-analyzer.ts /path/to/project
```

### Running Generated Migration Scripts

```bash
# Phase 1: Feature-based architecture
cd migration-scripts
./phase-1-feature-architecture.sh

# Phase 2: Component co-location  
./phase-2-component-colocation.sh

# Phase 3: Bundle optimization
./phase-3-bundle-optimization.sh

# Validate migration
./validate-migration.sh
```

## Example: Z2 Project Analysis

### Identified Issues
1. **Technical Folder Structure Anti-Pattern** (P0)
   - Current structure groups by technical role (components/, hooks/, services/)
   - **Impact**: High coupling, poor maintainability
   - **Solution**: Migrate to feature-based architecture

2. **TypeScript Strict Mode Disabled** (P0)  
   - Strict mode not enabled, reducing type safety
   - **Impact**: Potential runtime errors, reduced developer experience
   - **Solution**: Enable strict mode with gradual migration

3. **Component Co-location Missing** (P1)
   - Components not co-located with tests and related files
   - **Impact**: Reduced maintainability and discoverability
   - **Solution**: Implement co-location patterns

### Generated Migration Plan

#### Phase 1: Feature Architecture Migration
```bash
# Create feature directories
mkdir -p src/features/{auth,dashboard,agents,workflows,models}
mkdir -p src/shared/{components,hooks,utils,types}

# Move domain-specific files
mv src/components/LoginForm.tsx src/features/auth/components/
mv src/hooks/useAuth.tsx src/features/auth/hooks/
mv src/services/auth.ts src/features/auth/services/

# Update TypeScript configuration
# Add feature-based path mapping to tsconfig.json
```

#### Phase 2: Component Co-location
```bash
# Co-locate components with tests and barrel exports
mkdir -p src/shared/components/ui/Button
mv src/shared/components/ui/Button.tsx src/shared/components/ui/Button/
echo "export { Button } from './Button';" > src/shared/components/ui/Button/index.ts
```

#### Phase 3: Bundle Optimization
```bash
# Add lazy loading and code splitting
yarn add @loadable/component
# Update vite.config.ts with manual chunks
# Implement route-based code splitting
```
